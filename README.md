# 🩺 Diabetes Predictor - ML Web App

This is a machine learning-based web application built using **Readdy AI** that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on key health parameters. It uses a classification model trained on the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset and provides real-time predictions through a user-friendly interface.

> ✅ Created as part of InternPe ML Project Task.
